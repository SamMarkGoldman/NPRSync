# NPRSync
This python script will download the each mp3 story for NPR's daily news magazine show, since no podcast of the whole show exists.

To get it working, you will need SL4A installed on your android device, otherwise there is no python interpreter to run the script.

NOTE:  I am not a python programmer, but this seemed like the fastest way to scrape and download content on android after looking into the options.

I realize dependencies are not managed ideally, but I am not yet interesting in setting managing a whole development environment on my phone.  This works, which is the point.
